# Homework-1-Code-Refactor

To improve the existing website we were given for accessibility I replaced the standard div and span tags with semantic html tags, and added alt attributes to the images so that they are readable in the case that your image won't load, or if it's being read by a screen reader. I also added a title to the web page, and fixed the first link so that it linked you to the right area of the page.

To clean up the html doc, I added white space in a way that made the code more readable to me by grouping up elements in a section and separating sections from one another. I also added comments so that anybody else that's looking at my code would be able to see right away how I structured it.

To consolidate the CSS I grouped together like selectors and properties so that there was less repitition. I also reorganized it to follow the structure of the html page so that the first elements you see in your html doc are the first elements that are styled in the css file.

## User Story
AS A marketing agency

SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
